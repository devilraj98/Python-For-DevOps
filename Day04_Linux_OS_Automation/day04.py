#OS automation matters in DevOps because it allows for efficient management and configuration of operating systems across multiple servers. This automation helps in reducing manual errors, speeding up deployment processes, and ensuring consistency in system configurations. By automating tasks such as software installation, updates, and system monitoring, DevOps teams can focus more on development and less on repetitive administrative tasks.
