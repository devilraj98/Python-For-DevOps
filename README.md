# 🐍 Python for DevOps Engineer – Complete Syllabus

**From Zero to 4 Years of Experience (Industry-Oriented)**

---

## 📌 Course Objective

This syllabus is designed for **DevOps Engineers with no prior Python knowledge** and aims to build **production-grade Python skills** required in real DevOps roles (AWS, CI/CD, Linux, Kubernetes, Automation).

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

* Write Python automation scripts confidently
* Replace complex Bash scripts with Python
* Automate AWS infrastructure using Python
* Integrate Python in CI/CD pipelines
* Build DevOps CLI tools
* Crack **3–5 years experience DevOps Python interviews**

---

## 🧭 Learning Approach

* Beginner-friendly (assumes zero Python knowledge)
* DevOps-first (no generic Python theory)
* Linux & Cloud focused
* Script-heavy and scenario-based
* Interview + production aligned

---
